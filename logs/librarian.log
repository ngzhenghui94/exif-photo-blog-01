[INFO] Dispatching task to sub-agent (auto-gemini-3): You are Librarian. Your mission is to:
1. Research 'shadcn-map' to understand its installation requirements and API.
2. Analyze the current codebase (especially `src/photo`, `src/services`, and `src/utility`) to identify how EXIF GPS data (latitude, longitude) is extracted, stored, and retrieved.
3. Locate the existing photo data fetching logic to determine how to efficiently query photos that have location metadata.
4. Provide a summary of your findings to the team.

[OUTPUT] I will also perform a web search to clarify "shadcn-map".
[OUTPUT] I will list the files in `src/photo` and search for GPS-related terms in the codebase to understand how location data is currently handled.
